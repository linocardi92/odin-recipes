    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong>parmigiana di melanzane</strong> is a classic neapolitan recipe which has aubergines as its base.<br>
    There are a lot of variations of this recipe but I purpose the classic one;<br>
    for example there is the <em>sorrentina's version</em> in which the aubergines are breaded with eggs, flour and breadcrumbs.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Aubergines: </strong>3</li>
        <li><strong>Mozzarella: </strong>250 gr</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato souce: </strong>700 gr</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic: </strong>2 cloves</li>
        <li><strong>Basil: </strong>4 leaves</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan: </strong>50 gr</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil: </strong>4 spoons</li>
        <li><strong>salt: </strong>to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First clean and cut the aubergines into 0.5 cm thick slices</li>
        <li>Arrange the slices in a large bowl by seasoning each layer with salt (one tablespoon)</li>
        <li>After one hour press the aubergines to let out excess water</li>
        <li>Fry the aubergines in plenty of oil and at the same time fry the two cloves of garlic<br> in a pan without letting them brown too much.</li>
        <li>Put the tomato souce in the pan with the garlic and let it cook for 10 minutes until it thickens<br> then turn off the heat; add basil and salt</li>
        <li>Grease a baking dish and arrange a first layer of eggplants, side by side, without overlapping</li>
        <li>Pour two tablespoons of sauce over the eggplant and spread it evenly with the back of a spoon.<br>
            Sprinkle with a little Parmesan cheese, but don't overdo it</li>
        <li>Cut the mozzarella into very thin slices and arrange a few on top of the sauce, well spaced apart.<br>Repeat until all the ingredients are used.</li>
        <li>Finish with a generous layer of sauce, without adding any additional cheese, and a generous drizzle of olive oil.</li>
        <li>Bake the eggplant parmigiana at 200°C (400°F) for about 1 hour<br>
            Serve the eggplant parmigiana warm or cold.</li>
    </ol>
