    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Tiramisù</strong> is the quintessential <em>Italian dessert</em>, known worldwide for its creamy texture and bold coffee flavor.<br>
        This classic no-bake treat is made by layering espresso-soaked ladyfingers with a rich mascarpone cream,<br> lightly sweetened and whipped to perfection.<br> 
        The final touch is a dusting of bitter cocoa powder, which balances the sweetness and enhances its depth of flavor.<br> 
        This recipe is from the Italian web site: <a href="https://www.giallozafferano.com/recipes/Tiramisu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giallo zafferano's </a>.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mascarpone cheese: </strong>3 ⅓ cups (750 g)</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>5 (260 g) - (<em>very fresh, medium</em>)</li>
        <li><strong>Savoiardi (ladyfingers): </strong>8.75 oz (250 g)</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar: </strong> ⅔ cup (120 g)</li>
        <li><strong>Coffe: </strong>1 ⅓ cup (300 g) - (<em>made in a moka pot, with sugar to taste)</em></li>
        <li><strong>Unsweetened cocoa powder</strong> to taste for decorating</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the coffee using a moka pot to get 1 1/4 cups (300 g),<br> then add sugar to taste (we added a teaspoonful) and leave it to cool in a large, shallow bowl. </li>
        <li>Separate the eggs, being careful to keep the whites totally free of yolk 1 so that they will whip well.<br> Beat the yolks with a hand mixer, adding half of the sugar </li>
        <li>As soon as the mixture has turned light and foamy, and while the mixer is still running, add the mascarpone a little at a time</li>
        <li>Once all the mascarpone has been added, you'll have a dense, compact cream; set this aside.<br> Clean the mixer well and move on to whipping the egg whites. Once they're foamy, pour in the remaining sugar a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Whip the whites to stiff peaks; you'll know they're ready when you can turn the bowl upside down without the mixture moving.<br> Take a spoonful of the whites and add it to the bowl with the mascarpone cream, then stir vigorously with a spatula to dilute the mixture.<br> Next, add the rest of the egg whites little by little, folding them in by mixing very gently from the bottom upwards.</li>
        <li>The mascarpone cream is ready. Spread a heaping spoonful on the bottom of a glass baking dish measuring 9x13 inches (20x30 cm),<br> ensuring the entire base is covered. Now dip the ladyfingers into the cold coffee for a few seconds, first on one side and then on the other.</li>
        <li>Then arrange the coffee-soaked ladyfingers in the dish, trying to position them all in one direction, to form a first layer of cookies.<br> Add another layer of mascarpone cream and level it so the cookies are covered completely.</li>
        <li>Continue to add the coffee-soaked ladyfingers and cream in alternating layers, always leveling the surface of the cream.</li>
        <li>Finally, transfer the remaining cream to a pastry bag with a ½-inch (12-mm) plain tip and cover the entire surface of the tiramisu with dabs of cream. Sprinkle over the unsweetened cocoa powder and leave the tiramisu to set in the fridge for a couple of hours</li>
    </ol>
